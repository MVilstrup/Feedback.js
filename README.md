Feedback.js
===========

Feedback.js is a unobtrusive customizable JavaScript notification system, meant to make it simple for all to get qualitative feedback from their users all over their website. 

Qualitative feedback is important, because it allows the company to quickly figure out where to focus their limited resources, and track their users experience in real time as their update parts of their sites. 

I'm are hoping feedback.js will be able to improve websites and user experience all over the world.
